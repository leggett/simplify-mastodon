# Simplify Mastodon

Source code for simplifying the web interface for Mastodon. Works on top ~300 servers. 

Extension is live for Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-mastodon/dgbbcmkahpogmnkpoddlgfjbogogiakp

Use it on Firefox:
- Listed here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simplify-mastodon/
- Firefox doesn't enable :has() by default (which this extension uses a lot). 
- So to get the full functionality on Firefox, you have to enable this flag under about:config: layout.css.has-selector.enabled
- More info here: https://caniuse.com/css-has

No plans to support Safari.
